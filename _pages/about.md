I am a master student in Computer Science at Tongji University, expected to graduate in March 2026. My research primarily focuses on **multimodal intelligence**, including **multimodal retrieval and generation**, **reasoning with multimodal large language models**, and **their interaction in distributed environments**. My work aims to advance the capability of AI systems to understand and reason across multiple modalities while addressing challenges such as privacy preservation, trustworthy reasoning, and model efficiency.
