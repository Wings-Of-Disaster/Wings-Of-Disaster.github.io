I am a master student in Computer Science at Tongji University, expected to graduate in March 2026. My research primarily focuses on **multimodal AI**, including **multimodal retrieval and generation**, **reasoning with multimodal large language models**, and **multimodal federated learning**. My work aims to advance the capability of AI systems to understand, generate, and reason across multiple modalities while addressing challenges such as data heterogeneity, privacy constraints, and model efficiency.

## **üì¢ Actively Seeking 2026 Fall PhD Positions**

<span style="color:red;">I am actively seeking PhD opportunities starting Fall 2026. I would be thrilled to work with prospective advisors and research groups. Please feel free to contact me.</span>


## Research Interests

- **Multimodal Retrieval and Generation:** Developing methods that allow AI systems to efficiently retrieve and synthesize information across visual, textual, and medical data modalities. 
- **Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models:** Exploring efficient inference and adaptation of large-scale multimodal LLMs, including PEFT and knowledge graph-augmented reasoning; mitigated modality-induced biases.  
- **Multimodal Federated Learning:** Designing distributed learning frameworks for heterogeneous medical data; employed data-free knowledge distillation and modality reconstruction to enable collaborative training without sharing sensitive data.

## Publications & Selected Works

I have published multiple works in top-tier conferences, focusing on multimodal AI and reasoning. Some representative works include:

- **[VaLiK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12972):** Aligning Vision to Language: Annotation-Free Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction for Enhanced LLMs Reasoning. (ICCV 2025, Accepted)  

- **[HM-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12330):** HM-RAG: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation. (ACM MM 2025, Accepted)


For a complete list of publications, please refer to my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=U8CS_BwAAAAJ&hl=en-US).

## Professional Service

I serve as a reviewer for **ICME, SMC, and AAAI**, contributing to the peer-review process in the fields of computer vision, multimodal AI, and machine learning.

## Skills & Tools

- **Programming & Frameworks:** Python, PyTorch, distributed training, Linux, C/C++, Java  
- **Languages:** Chinese (native), English (IELTS 7.0), Japanese, German  
- **Specialized Knowledge:** Multimodal foundation models, medical image analysis, knowledge graph construction, PEFT, diffusion models  

## Collaborations & Opportunities

I am actively seeking collaborations with researchers and students interested in **multimodal AI**, **distributed learning**, and **large model inference**. If you are interested in discussing joint projects, sharing ideas, or contributing to ongoing research, feel free to reach out via email or GitHub.
